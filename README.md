# A simple Tic Tac Toe
My version of tic tac toe is pretty simple. There is no AI or online multiplayer. It's just a way to play tic tac toe with a local friend :). To reset the game after completing a match, just click the board.

# Javascript Practice
I am just learning javascript, in fact this is my first javascript project. I honestly didn't do much research beforehand on javascript. I just kind of went for it and while I was programming this I tryed to learn as much as possible. This project is guarenteed to be flawed. I'm probably doing a few things that would make a javascript vetern cringe into his esophagus, but that's okay. As long as I can find, change, and learn from those mistakes. 

# Wanna help me out?
Like I said this project was build to help me learn javascript. So, if you already know javascript, then help me out!. I am stupid, so this project has a ton of mistakes, or things that are considered "poor practice". If you see something like this, please tell me! I haven't used github much, but I'd think that would fit in the "Issues" tab. Thanks!

# The Future
In the future I plan to continue practicing by adding a few more features. Mainly I want to add an AI to play against in case you have no friends, like me. I also would like to work with nodejs or some other backend and set up online multiplayer. Other than that I eventually want to add this to a larger "hub" website, maybe as a portforilo, maybe just for fun.
